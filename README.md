# SCRATCH_ML
People from non ML background , **demystifying chatGpt** We will go step by step learning fundamentals and abstracting them into blackbox components to hopefully build a giant AI model 



# Basic Knowledge and Portals
To get started in Machine Learning , you should know 2+2 = 4 and 2 +x = 4 , implies x =2 and here x is a placeholder . In programming also known as variable. This much knowledge is enough for anyone to get started with machine learning. Rest Other requirements like knowing Linear Algebra , Python , Calculus All this is just 2 + x = 4 only . :D

**We will be learning and exploring on our way and understand** : Following are the questions which we will be asking ourselves to realize we already know it , it's just people call it with different name.

What we want to do ? Why we want to do it ? If you are the only person who is inventing this first time , how you would have done it. what do other people call you method of solving it .

Finally , Does there exist any better solution for doing this which will be an abstraction black box .
